# SADViz
Welcome to the Super Awesome Dynamic Visualisation (SADViz) plugin for Protégé 5. This plugin was developed as a project for the University of Cape Town Computer Sciences 3rd year, to graph the classes and their respected relationships of ontologies with Protégé. 

Installation: To install SADViz, ensure the Protégé 5 is installed on your computer. Navigate to the Protégé folder and locate the plugins folder. Once you have downloaded and extracted the SADViz plugin from this repository, navigate to the target folder where the SADViz-1.0.0.jar file is located. Copy the jar file into the plugins folder mentioned earlier. Restart Protégé if you previously had it open. To confirm the plugin has been successfully installed, run Protégé and navigate the menu: Window > Tabs, SADViz should be located within the tabs list. If it is not there a problem occurred during the installation process and it is recommended you build and clean the package using a software such as Maven. 

Instruction Manual: Included within the package is an instruction manual detailing how to make use of the plugin and all its embedded functionality.
